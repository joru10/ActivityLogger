 Okay, so today I've been working on different things, but most of the time I have spent on debugging the activity report. This is a coding application, coding activity. And I've been working on this for about five hours today. And in addition to that, I've been looking at news, part of the research activity, and getting up to date with the news about artificial intelligence for about, let's say, one hour during the whole day. And in addition to that, I've been looking at some training as well for about 30 minutes.
