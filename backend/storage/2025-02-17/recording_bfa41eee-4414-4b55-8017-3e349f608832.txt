 Okay, so this morning so far I've been working on watching a number of videos, maybe about AA news. This has probably spent about an hour of time, of my time this morning. And then in addition to that I've been also looking at a couple of papers and also in the area of research. And in addition to that I've been mainly working with the coding of the activity report application, the activity reports project and on that I've been spending probably about 90 minutes this morning.
