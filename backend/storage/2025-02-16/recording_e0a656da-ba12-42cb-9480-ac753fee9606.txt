 Okay, so this morning I've been working mostly on debugging, I've been spending about 90 minutes so far this morning on debugging the activity report application, so this is on the coding side. At the same time I've been also watching news and getting up to date with what's going on in the AI, and that's been spending about 40 minutes on that.
