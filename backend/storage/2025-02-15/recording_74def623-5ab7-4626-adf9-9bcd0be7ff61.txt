 Okay, so over the past hour I've been working mostly with continuing looking at videos about different things for main vNews. So we are in the chapter of research. Let's say I've spent about 30 minutes on that. I've also been looking at the activity report recorder application just to complete some stuff and I'm now starting to work on creating a documentation, additional documentation for it. Let's say for that I would just put 15 minutes on that and the rest I've been looking into well other activities related to the property we have in Spain that will be within the financial planning stuff or things.
