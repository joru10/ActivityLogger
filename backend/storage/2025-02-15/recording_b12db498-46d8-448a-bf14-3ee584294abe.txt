 Okay, so here we are again and this is bad news because it looks like we lost everything. But anyway, as to the reporting for the past couple of hours, I've been mostly working on the activity reports, on the coding and the debugging of the application. Let's say for two hours in the day so far. And I also spent another two hours during the day in research activities. Watching videos and reviewing news and getting up to date with the things in the world of AI.
