 Okay, so this morning I've been spending about a full hour listening to different news-related outlets about AI, just as part of my research activity. And I've been also looking a bit into this, what the news was about an hour, I don't know what I said, but I think it can add up to an hour. And then I've been also looking at the activity report coding, but just 15 minutes.
