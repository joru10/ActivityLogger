 Okay, so in the last hour I've been off for lunch, so this is not to be recorded, in fact. Before that I spent about 45 minutes on the activity report and the coding side of things to complete some aspects that were still buggy, so to debug and to fix those things. And I also spent about 30 minutes on the videos about news and new tools for AI.
