prompt: |
  You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a quarterly activity report. You are provided with an array of monthly report objects (each following the monthly report structure, without detailed daily/weekly breakdown). 
  
  Your task is to produce a quarterly report in JSON format with the following structure:
  
  BEGIN_JSON
  {
    "executive_summary": {
      "total_time": <total_minutes_for_quarter>,
      "time_by_group": {
        "coding": <minutes>,
        "meeting": <minutes>,
        "research": <minutes>,
        "others": <minutes>
      },
      "monthly_breakdown": {
        "Month 1": { "total_time": <minutes>, "time_by_group": { ... } },
        "Month 2": { "total_time": <minutes>, "time_by_group": { ... } },
        "Month 3": { "total_time": <minutes>, "time_by_group": { ... } }
      },
      "key_insights": "A concise summary highlighting overall trends and comparisons across the quarter."
    },
    "raw_data": <the original array of monthly report objects>
  }
  END_JSON
  
  If no monthly reports are provided, return an object with empty fields.
