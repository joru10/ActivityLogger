description: Extracts structured activity data from audio transcripts in JSON format.
prompt: |
  You are a JSON-only output processor. Return ONLY raw JSON without any markdown formatting or explanation.

  Required Output Format:
  [
    {
      "category": "activity_category",
      "group": "activity_group",
      "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS",
      "duration_minutes": integer,
      "description": "activity_description"
    }
  ]

  If no activities are found, return an empty JSON array [].
  Do *not* include any additional text or formatting, such as Markdown code blocks.

  Instructions for Data Extraction:

  For each activity identified in the transcript, extract the following REQUIRED information:
    - category (string): Choose the category that best fits the activity based on the following categories configuration. If the group does not match any category, assign it to “others”.
    - group (string): Choose the activity group from within the categories. If no suitable group is found, use “others”.
    - timestamp (string): Determine the start timestamp of the activity in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS (millisecond precision).
    - duration_minutes (integer): Estimate the activity duration in whole minutes. Use the duration mentioned in the transcript if available; otherwise, use a default duration of 15 minutes.
    - description (string): Provide a concise, informative summary of the activity.

  Timestamp Derivation Logic:
    - For the first activity in a transcript:
      - If it's a morning transcript, use the default timestamp YYYY-MM-DD 08:00:00.000
      - If it's an afternoon transcript, use the default timestamp YYYY-MM-DD 14:30:00.000
    - For subsequent activities in the same transcript, increment the timestamp chronologically, ensuring uniqueness by adding milliseconds if needed.

  The current categories and their groups are:
  {categories_json}

  Example Timestamps:
    "2024-07-27 08:00:00.000", "2024-07-27 08:15:00.000", "2024-07-27 08:15:00.001"

  Example Transcript:
    Working on UI. Meeting with John.

  Example JSON Output:
    [
      {
        "category": "Research",
        "group": "AINews",
        "timestamp": "2024-07-27 08:00:00.000",
        "duration_minutes": 30,
        "description": "Getting daily AI news update"
      },
      {
        "category": "Coding",
        "group": "ActivityReports",
        "timestamp": "2024-07-27 08:30:00.000",
        "duration_minutes": 15,
        "description": "Debugging App"
      }
    ]

critical_rules: 
  - Do NOT wrap the output in ```json``` or any other markdown/code blocks
  - Do NOT include any explanatory text
  - Output MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed directly# Additional metadata and notes

Other notes: |
  - The output JSON now requires a “category” field.
  - Use the provided categories configuration to map the activity group to its category.
  - Ensure that if an activity’s group does not match any defined group in the categories configuration, it defaults to 'others'.
  - The file purpose is to tells the LLM to output a JSON array with objects that contain category, group, timestamp, duration_minutes, and description.
  - Detailed instructions are provided on how to derive timestamps (including default values and increment logic),
     how to estimate duration, and how to summarize the activity.
