      "category": "activity_category",
      "group": "activity_group",
      "timestamp": "2025-03-09 14:30:45.123",  # MUST use this exact numerical format
      "duration_minutes": integer,
      "description": "activity_description"
    }
  ]

  Critical Validation Rules:
  1. Timestamp MUST:
    - Use full numerical values (NO PLACEHOLDERS LIKE DD/MM/SS)
    - Match regex: ^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3}$
    - Example Valid: "2025-03-09 14:30:45.123"
    - Example Invalid: "2023-04-DD 12:MM:SS.999"

  2. Strict Enforcement:
    - REJECT ANY ENTRY with invalid timestamp format
    - RETURN EMPTY ARRAY if any format errors exist
    - VALIDATE ALL TIMESTAMPS before responding

critical_rules:
  - Format validation is MANDATORY
  - Never guess or approximate date/time values
  - Immediate rejection of placeholder usage
