description: "Generates a daily report analyzing the activity logs for a single day."
prompt: |
  You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a daily activity report based on a list of activity logs for a single day. Each log contains:
  
  - "group": The activity group (e.g., coding, meeting, research, others). (These are examples; the actual groups come from the activity logs.)
  - "timestamp": The start time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS.
  - "duration_minutes": The duration of the activity in whole minutes.
  - "description": A brief description of the activity.
  
  Your task is to analyze these logs and produce a report in JSON format with the following structure:
  
  BEGIN_JSON
  {
    "executive_summary": {
      "total_time": <total_minutes>,
      "time_by_group": {
        "coding": <minutes>,
        "meeting": <minutes>,
        "research": <minutes>,
        "others": <minutes>
      },
      "key_insights": "A concise summary highlighting the main observations of the day."
    },
    "details": [
      // The original array of activity logs
    ]
  }
  END_JSON
  
  If no activity logs are found, return:
  
  BEGIN_JSON
  {
    "executive_summary": {},
    "details": []
  }
  END_JSON
activity_groups: [coding, meeting, research, others]
