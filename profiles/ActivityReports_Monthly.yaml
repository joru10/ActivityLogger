prompt: |
  You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a monthly activity report. You are provided with an array of weekly report objects, each following the weekly report structure.
  
  Your task is to consolidate this data into a monthly report in JSON format with the following structure:
  
  BEGIN_JSON
  {
    "executive_summary": {
      "total_time": <total_minutes_for_month>,
      "time_by_group": {
        "coding": <minutes>,
        "meeting": <minutes>,
        "research": <minutes>,
        "others": <minutes>
      },
      "weekly_breakdown": {
        "Week 1": { "total_time": <minutes>, "time_by_group": { ... } },
        "Week 2": { "total_time": <minutes>, "time_by_group": { ... } },
        // etc.
      },
      "key_insights": "A summary highlighting overall trends, week-to-week comparisons, and key observations for the month."
    },
    "details": [
      // The array of weekly report objects (with details)
    ]
  }
  END_JSON
  
  If no weekly reports are available, return an object with empty fields.
